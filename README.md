Scatterplot comparing True Shooting and Win percentage for the top 50 players, who played the most games in the 2020-2021 season.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I evaluated outliers for my win% variable as some players were traded mid season, I took the average for the teams that they played on. Also this data set was  organized based on the top 50 players and by the most amount of games played.
