Around 350 values, removed players who played less than 20 games. 
Updated version with all the teams, not just 50 players, little convoluded but the highest win rate team Utah at 0.722, is at the top while the bottom team is Houston with 0.236. 
Some loose numbers with players who were traded, decided to give their stats to the team they were traded to.
Found the Pearson's R to be: 0.223486.

Makes sense, some players shined on the bad teams and vice versa.
The Center position had some of the highest True shooting percentages on the teams.

Josh Hall of The Oklahoma City Thunder had the lowest true shooting % with 0.363 played exaclty 20 games.

Highest Trus Shooting % was DeAndre Jordan of The Brooklyn Nets, with 0.736

Scatterplot comparing True Shooting and Win percentage for the top 50 players, who played the most games in the 2020-2021 season.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I evaluated outliers for my win% variable as some players were traded mid season, I took the average for the teams that they played on. Also this data set was  organized based on the top 50 players and by the most amount of games played.
